Info    : Created nominal operating condition. [LBR-412]
        : Operating condition '_nominal_' was created for the PVT values (1.000000, 1.980000, -40.000000) in library 'tsl18fs120_scl_ff.lib'.
        : The nominal operating condition represents either the nominal PVT values if specified in the library source, or the default PVT values (1.0, 1.0, 1.0).
